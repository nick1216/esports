# 🔧 Critical Proxy Fix - API Calls

## 🐛 The Problem You Found

**You were absolutely right!** The scraper had a critical flaw:

### What Was Happening:

1. **Browser automation** (collecting match IDs from CS500 website)

   - ✅ Used proxy correctly
   - ✅ Routed through Canada

2. **API calls** (fetching market data from CS500 API)
   - ❌ **Did NOT use proxy**
   - ❌ Used your actual IP address
   - ❌ CS500 blocked it because you're not in Canada!

## 🔍 The Issue

```python
# Browser used proxy ✅
browser_args.append(f"--proxy-server={self.proxy_server}")

# But aiohttp API calls did NOT! ❌
async with aiohttp.ClientSession(timeout=timeout) as session:
    await session.get(url, headers=headers)  # No proxy!
```

So even if the browser successfully collected match IDs through the proxy, when the scraper tried to fetch the actual market data from CS500's API, it failed because it wasn't using the proxy!

---

## ✅ The Fix

Now **both** parts use the proxy:

### 1. Browser Automation (Already Working)

```python
browser_args = ["--proxy-server=http://216.26.250.98:3129"]
```

### 2. API Calls (NOW FIXED!)

```python
async with session.get(url, headers=headers, proxy=self.proxy_server) as response:
```

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before:

```
🌐 Browser → Proxy → CS500 Website → ✅ Get match IDs
📡 API calls → Direct → CS500 API → ❌ BLOCKED (not in Canada)
```

### After:

```
🌐 Browser → Proxy → CS500 Website → ✅ Get match IDs
📡 API calls → Proxy → CS500 API → ✅ Get markets (via Canada proxy)
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Deploy:

```bash
git add scraper.py PROXY_FIX.md
git commit -m "Fix: Route API calls through proxy as well as browser"
git push
```

### Watch Railway Logs For:

**Proxy initialization:**

```
🌐 Using proxy: http://216.26.250.98:3129
🧪 Testing proxy connection...
✅ Proxy working! Your IP through proxy: {"ip":"216.26.250.98"}
```

**Browser scraping:**

```
🌐 Browser configured with proxy: http://216.26.250.98:3129
🎮 Starting full CS500 scrape (match IDs + markets)
✅ Collected 15 match IDs
```

**API calls (NEW!):**

```
🌐 Using proxy for market API calls: http://216.26.250.98:3129
✅ Scraped 120 markets
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix:

- Browser collects match IDs ✅
- But API calls fail to get markets ❌
- Result: 0 markets scraped

### After Fix:

- Browser collects match IDs ✅
- API calls get markets through proxy ✅
- Result: Full scraping success! 🎉

## 💡 Why This Matters

CS500 checks your **geographical location** for BOTH:

1. **Website access** (browser)
2. **API access** (market data)

If either part doesn't go through the Canadian proxy, CS500 will block it!

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Check 1: Proxy Test Passes

```
✅ Proxy working! Your IP through proxy: {"ip":"216.26.250.98"}
```

### Check 2: Match IDs Collected

```
✅ Collected 15 match IDs
```

### Check 3: Markets Fetched (THIS WAS FAILING BEFORE!)

```
🌐 Using proxy for market API calls: http://...
✅ Scraped 120 markets
```

If all three succeed, you're fully proxied! 🇨🇦

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If proxy test fails:

```
⚠️ Proxy test failed: Connection timed out
```

→ Proxy is down, get a new one

### If match IDs collected but NO markets:

```
✅ Collected 15 match IDs
❌ Error fetching market via proxy: Connection timeout
```

→ Proxy is too slow for API calls, try a faster proxy

### If markets fetched but show errors:

```
⚠️ Failed to fetch market X via proxy: HTTP 403
```

→ CS500 is blocking your proxy IP, try a different proxy

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Your Question: "Is the scraper running off of the proxy as well?"**

**Answer:**

- **Before**: Only the browser was using the proxy ❌
- **After**: BOTH browser AND API calls use the proxy ✅

This was likely the root cause of your scraping failures!

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy this fix**
2. **Test on Railway**
3. **Check logs** for "Using proxy for market API calls"
4. **Verify markets are actually scraped**

If this still doesn't work, the proxy itself might be:

- Too slow
- Blocked by CS500
- Unreliable (free proxies often are)

Consider a paid Canadian residential proxy for production! 🇨🇦
