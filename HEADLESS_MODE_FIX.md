# 🎭 Headless Mode with Stealth - CS500 Scraper

## 🔄 What Changed

Switched from **non-headless + Xvfb** to **headless + stealth mode**.

### **Why:**

- Xvfb was having issues with element detection
- nodriver has built-in anti-detection that works in headless
- Simpler setup, no virtual display needed
- Faster startup on Railway

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Scraper (`scraper.py`)**

**Before:**

```python
headless=False  # Required Xvfb virtual display
```

**After:**

```python
headless=True  # Works with stealth flags
```

**Added stealth flags:**

- `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` - Hides automation
- `--disable-features=IsolateOrigins,site-per-process` - Better compatibility
- Custom user agent - Looks like real Chrome
- All Docker-safe flags maintained

### 2. **Dockerfile**

**Removed:**

- `xvfb` package
- `x11-utils` package
- DISPLAY environment variable

**Kept:**

- All Chrome dependencies
- Headless Chrome support

### 3. **start.sh**

**Before:**

```bash
# Start Xvfb
Xvfb :99 ...
export DISPLAY=:99
```

**After:**

```bash
# Direct start, no Xvfb needed
exec uvicorn api:app ...
```

## 🎯 Advantages of Headless + Stealth

### ✅ **Pros:**

- **Simpler** - No Xvfb process management
- **Faster** - No virtual display overhead
- **More reliable** - Fewer moving parts
- **Built-in stealth** - nodriver designed for this
- **Better logging** - Clearer error messages

### ⚠️ **Cons:**

- Some sites detect headless browsers
- But nodriver has excellent anti-detection

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **After Deploying:**

```bash
git add scraper.py Dockerfile start.sh HEADLESS_MODE_FIX.md
git commit -m "Switch to headless mode with stealth for CS500 scraper"
git push
```

### **Check Railway Logs:**

**Success:**

```
🚀 Starting FastAPI application (headless mode)...
🔧 Browser config: headless=True (with stealth)
🌐 Browser configured with proxy
✅ [lol] Page loaded
🎯 [lol] Found 15 match links
```

**If Failed:**

```
❌ [lol] Failed to start browser
```

## 🔧 Alternative Options (If Headless Fails)

### **Option 2: Playwright**

If nodriver headless doesn't work, try Playwright:

```python
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async with async_playwright() as p:
    browser = await p.chromium.launch(
        headless=True,
        proxy={"server": proxy_url}
    )
```

**Pros:** Very stable, excellent stealth
**Cons:** Requires code rewrite

### **Option 3: Selenium with undetected-chromedriver**

```python
import undetected_chromedriver as uc

driver = uc.Chrome(
    options=chrome_options,
    headless=True,
    use_subprocess=False
)
```

**Pros:** Well-tested anti-detection
**Cons:** Requires code changes

### **Option 4: Go Back to Xvfb (Last Resort)**

If headless absolutely doesn't work:

```python
headless=False  # Revert
```

And restore Xvfb in Dockerfile/start.sh

## 🎭 How nodriver Stealth Works

**nodriver** (based on undetected-chromedriver) automatically:

- Patches Chrome DevTools Protocol
- Removes `webdriver` property
- Randomizes user agent
- Mimics real browser behavior
- Works in headless mode!

**Key flags we added:**

```python
"--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled"  # Main stealth flag
"--disable-features=IsolateOrigins,site-per-process"  # Compatibility
"--user-agent=..."  # Real Chrome UA
```

---

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Mode                   | Startup Time | Memory | Detection Risk | Reliability |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Headless + Stealth** | ~5-10s       | Low    | Low (nodriver) | High        |
| Non-headless + Xvfb    | ~15-20s      | Medium | Very Low       | Medium      |
| Plain Headless         | ~5s          | Low    | High           | Low         |

## 🎯 Expected Results

### **With Residential Proxy + Headless Stealth:**

This combination should work because:

1. ✅ **Residential proxy** = Real Canadian home IP
2. ✅ **Headless stealth** = nodriver's anti-detection
3. ✅ **Proper flags** = Looks like real browser
4. ✅ **Real user agent** = Mimics Chrome 120

CS500 will see:

- Canadian residential IP (not datacenter) ✅
- Chrome 120 browser (stealth patched) ✅
- Normal browsing behavior ✅

---

## 🚀 Deploy and Test

```bash
# Make sure Railway has residential proxy set:
PROXY_SERVER=http://m23vsbl33lpjnkv:7utf02325mih5xj@rp.scrapegw.com:6060

# Deploy
git push

# Test on Railway
# Click "🎮 CS500 Full Scrape"
# Check logs for success
```

---

## 💡 Bottom Line

**Headless + Stealth + Residential Proxy** = Best chance of success!

- Simpler than Xvfb
- nodriver designed for this
- Residential proxy adds extra legitimacy
- Should bypass CS500's detection

If this doesn't work, we'll try Playwright next! 🎭
