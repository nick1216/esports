# 🔧 CS500 Timeout Fix

## 🐛 The Problem

```
lol attempt 3/3 failed: time ran out while waiting for #betby
All attempts failed for lol
```

This means:

- ✅ Browser starts successfully
- ✅ Xvfb is working
- ❌ Page elements not loading in time

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Increased Timeout** (15s → 45s)

```python
await page.wait_for('#betby', timeout=45)
```

Proxy connections are slower, need more time.

### 2. **Longer Retry Delays** (2s → 5s)

```python
await asyncio.sleep(5)
```

Give proxy more time between retries.

### 3. **Page Reloading on Retry**

```python
await page.reload()
```

Fresh page load attempt for each retry.

### 4. **Enhanced Debug Logging**

Now shows step-by-step progress:

```
🌐 [lol] Navigating to: https://...
✅ [lol] Page navigation started
🔍 [lol] Attempt 1/3: Waiting for page to load...
✅ [lol] Page loaded, looking for host element...
🎯 [lol] Found 15 match links
```

### 5. **Proxy Connection Test**

Tests proxy on initialization:

```
🧪 Testing proxy connection...
✅ Proxy working! Your IP through proxy: {"ip":"142.93.123.45"}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Deploy:

```bash
git add scraper.py
git commit -m "Increase timeouts and add better debugging for CS500 scraper"
git push
```

### Watch Railway Logs:

**Step 1: Proxy Test**

```
🌐 Using proxy: http://216.26.250.98:3129
🧪 Testing proxy connection...
✅ Proxy working! Your IP through proxy: {...}
```

_If this fails, your proxy is down/blocked!_

**Step 2: Browser Start**

```
🔧 Browser config: headless=False, display=:99
```

**Step 3: Page Loading**

```
🌐 [lol] Navigating to: https://csgo500.com/sports?bt-path=%2Fleague-of-legends-110
✅ [lol] Page navigation started
🔍 [lol] Attempt 1/3: Waiting for page to load...
```

**Success:**

```
✅ [lol] Page loaded, looking for host element...
🎯 [lol] Found 15 match links
✅ Collected 15 match IDs
```

**Timeout (if still failing):**

```
❌ [lol] Attempt 1/3 failed: time ran out while waiting for #betby
⏳ [lol] Waiting 5 seconds before retry...
🔄 [lol] Reloading page...
🔍 [lol] Attempt 2/3: Waiting for page to load...
```

## 💡 Possible Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Proxy Test Fails

**Symptoms:**

```
⚠️ Proxy test failed: [Errno 110] Connection timed out
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Proxy is dead** - Get a new proxy from ProxyScrape
2. **Proxy is slow** - Try a different proxy
3. **Railway blocking proxy** - Try a different proxy provider

**How to fix:**

```bash
# Get new proxy from ProxyScrape and update Railway variable:
PROXY_SERVER=http://NEW_IP:NEW_PORT
```

---

### Issue 2: Still Timing Out After 45 Seconds

**Symptoms:**

```
❌ [lol] Attempt 3/3 failed: time ran out while waiting for #betby
💀 [lol] All attempts failed
```

**Solutions:**

**A. Try without proxy (test from local machine):**

```powershell
# Local test without proxy
$env:PROXY_SERVER=""
python run_cs500_scraper.py
```

If this works, the proxy is the issue.

**B. Increase timeout even more** (scraper.py line 378):

```python
await page.wait_for('#betby', timeout=90)  # Try 90 seconds
```

**C. Try a faster proxy:**

- Use a paid proxy service (more reliable)
- Use residential proxy instead of datacenter
- Try different proxy locations

---

### Issue 3: Proxy Works But Page Still Fails

**Symptoms:**

```
✅ Proxy working! Your IP through proxy: {...}
❌ [lol] Attempt 3/3 failed: time ran out while waiting for #betby
```

**Possible causes:**

1. **CS500 is blocking the proxy IP**

   - Solution: Try a different proxy
   - Use residential proxy (harder to detect)

2. **CS500 changed their layout**

   - Solution: Check if selector `#betby` still exists
   - Visit CS500 manually to verify site structure

3. **CS500 is down**

   - Solution: Wait and try again later

4. **Page requires interaction before loading**
   - Solution: May need to add human-like behavior (scroll, click)

---

### Issue 4: CS500 Detecting Bot

**Symptoms:**

```
✅ [lol] Page loaded, looking for host element...
⚠️ [lol] Host element not found
```

**Solutions:**

**A. Add random delays:**

```python
await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(2, 5))
```

**B. Add more realistic browser behavior:**

```python
await page.scroll_down(random.randint(100, 500))
await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

**C. Use better proxy:**

- Residential proxies look more like real users
- Avoid free/public proxies (easily detected)

## 🎯 Quick Diagnosis

Run this flowchart:

1. **Does proxy test pass?**

   - ❌ No → Get new proxy
   - ✅ Yes → Continue

2. **Does page start loading?**

   - ❌ No → Check proxy/network
   - ✅ Yes → Continue

3. **Does page timeout after 45 seconds?**

   - ✅ Yes → Proxy too slow OR CS500 blocking
   - ❌ No → Continue

4. **Is host element found?**
   - ❌ No → CS500 layout changed OR bot detected
   - ✅ Yes → Success!

## 🚀 Recommended Proxies

If your current proxy keeps failing, try these:

### Free Options (Testing Only):

- https://www.proxy-list.download/HTTPS (filter CA)
- https://free-proxy-list.net/ (filter Canada)
- ⚠️ Expect frequent failures

### Paid Options (Production):

1. **Smartproxy** ($75/mo) - Good balance

   - Fast residential Canadian IPs
   - https://smartproxy.com

2. **Bright Data** ($500/mo) - Most reliable

   - Enterprise-grade
   - https://brightdata.com

3. **ProxyMesh** ($60/mo) - Budget friendly
   - Datacenter IPs
   - https://proxymesh.com

## 📊 Expected Timeline

With fixes applied:

- **Proxy test**: 2-5 seconds
- **Browser start**: 5-10 seconds
- **Page load**: 10-30 seconds
- **Element scraping**: 5-15 seconds
- **Total**: 30-60 seconds per game

If it takes longer than 60 seconds, your proxy is likely too slow.

## 🛠️ Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fix**
2. **Check Railway logs** for detailed debug output
3. **If proxy test fails** → Get new proxy
4. **If still timing out** → Try paid proxy service
5. **If element not found** → CS500 may have changed (let me know!)

---

**Remember:** Free proxies are unreliable. For production, invest in a paid Canadian residential proxy service!
